Functions and scripts supporting the following study: Spontaneous dynamic reconfiguration of Intrinsic Neural Timescales core-periphery topography.

For MATLAB, you will need to install/download:
- EntropyHub https://github.com/MattWillFlood/EntropyHub/tree/main/EntropyHub%20-%20MatLab (which requires the Signal Processing Toolbox and the Statistics and MAchine Learning Toolbox);
- the function "knee_pt" Dmitry Kaplan (2024). Knee Point (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/35094-knee-point), MATLAB Central File Exchange;
- core-periphery organization as in T. Ito, L. J. Hearne, M. W. Cole, A cortical hierarchy of localized and distributed processes revealed via dissociation of task activations, connectivity changes, and intrinsic timescales. NeuroImage 221, 117141 (2020);
- myelination map, which can be found in B. Q. Rosen, E. Halgren, A Whole-Cortex Probabilistic Diffusion Tractography Connectome. eNeuro 8, ENEURO.0416-20.2020 (2021).

Functions native to MATLAB used in this study are referenced in the manuscript.


Code is written in both Python and MATLAB. Several toolboxes are needed to run these scripts: if any of these toolboxes/packages are not listed here, feel free to contact the corresponding authors.
