function [acw_0, acw_50, acf, lags] = yasir_acw(x, fs, varargin)
%% Calculate ACW-0 and ACW-50
% This function doesn't follow Honey et al.'s version (averaging ACW
% values in 50% overlapping 20s segments). Instead, it's a direct version that
% is more suitable for fMRI data due to it's low temporal resolution.
% x is input time series. If 'plot' is an input, then plots ACW_0 and
% ACW_50. fs is sampling rate in seconds. if not specified, fs defaults to
% 1.
